When I was freaking out my skin care routine something that really helped
me was finding information. Some of the resources that I found really
helpful were communities on Reddit. The reason why I found read Reddit a 
very useful resource it was because I was able to get tips and advice from 
people first hand. Additionally since posts can reach many people I was able 
to find out differing opinions and tips for finding a derm. I found a sense 
of community on the skin care page and I felt like I was able to have a sense of 
camaraderie going into the skin care process as a newbie.

Something that I would advise against is taking information as a fact online. The
pages I used were nice for basic skin care like cleansers and how to find derms
which did not cover medical concerns. Even for basic skin care opinions vary so 
don't take on person's idea as a fact. For medical questions try to seek a doctor.
